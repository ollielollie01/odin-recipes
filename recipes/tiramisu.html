        <h2>How to Make Tiramisu</h2>
       
        <p>Tiramisu is a coffee-flavored dessert that features layers of homemade whipped cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers.</p>
        <p>Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as <strong>"the father of tiramisu."</strong> The word "tiramisu" translates to <em>"pick-me-up."</em></p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated tiramisu recipe:</p>

        <h3>Tiramisu Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream:</strong> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Mascarpone:</strong> Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Rum:</strong> Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.</li>
            <li><strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.</li>
        </ul>
